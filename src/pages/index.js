                  <br />On the third of January 1957, a boy named Peter was born in Manawatu, New Zealand to David and Joan Cleland. Who would have thought this boy 's birth would change so many people 's lives. He was the first of 7 children to David and Joan, the family eventually being named the Cleland Clan that today has 27 grand-children and 15 great-grandchildren.

It was at high school that Peter’s personal legacy started to build; according to him he was very good at boxing, and particularly good at boxing any other student that looked at any of his brothers the wrong way.</p>

Adrienne didn 't know what she was getting in to by getting involved with Peter – but nonetheless things seemed to work out quite well and Peter and Adrienne were engaged while Peter had a stint working close to Whangarei. They were married in January 1979 and as Adrienne said this week, there wasn’t a single day in the last 42 years when she didn’t know she was fully loved by Peter. Above any other achievement or success, in today’s world that is perhaps the most underrated and yet significant difference that Peter has made in the world</p>

New friendships were made that continue today. Peter continued working for the Dairy Board where he was involved in the construction of dairy factories, both in NZ and China.Returning to Palmerston North in 1990, Peter became the General Manager for the NZ Horticulture and Food Research Institute and at the same time completed an MBA at Massey.</p>

Sadly we were all one phone call short of hearing of Isaac’s success in the defence of his PhD just last Friday, but we all know we would have received that phone call from a very proud Dad!</p>

Peter has appeared in several TV ads as well as a guest appearance with an odd American accent in Shortland Street. Peter was most recently director and manager of Molesworth Fruit Auckland Limited. On top his myriad of professional and educational achievements, Peter also had a myriad of personal ‘hobbies’, from martial arts to golf, train sets, Apple technology, playing the guitar etc. </p>
